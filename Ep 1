[[
multi lined
comment
also ignored

Variable:
local word = "LET'S GOOOOO I CAN FINALLY DO SOMETHING")

Outputers:
print("WSG G") -- type: print output: WSG G
warn("FINE WHAT ABT U") -- type: warning output: FINE WHAT ABT U
error("AWESOME") -- type: error output: AWESOME

Mix of those third
local word = "SCRIPTERS"
print("HELLO "..word)
-- this shouldn't be too hard
[[
also it's a bit different
and the output is: HELLO SCRIPTERS
]]

A for count loop -- is what i call it
for i=1,2 do
print("WOULD U MIND ME GOING GAGAGAG "..i)
end
[[
output:
WOULD U MIND ME GOING GAGAGAG 1
WOULD U MIND ME GOING GAGAGAG 2

for i=1,[amount of times it does it] do
do whatever
end -- just to end it
]]

-- later i would update this:>
